# Raw HTTP walkthrough: 402 → pay → 200

x402 is plain HTTP. Here is the exact wire flow with `curl` against a local
server (`npm run dev` — it ships with working default receive addresses).

## 1. Free routes need no payment

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4021/info | jq
curl -s http://localhost:4021/.well-known/x402 | jq
```

## 2. Calling a paid route without payment → HTTP 402

```bash
curl -si "http://localhost:4021/availability?party=2"
```

```
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
Content-Type: application/json

}
```

Two entries, two rails: **USDC on Base** and **USDC on Solana**. `1000` is
0.001 USDC in atomic units (6 decimals). Pick one, ignore the other.

The 402 body is machine-readable: it tells any client exactly what to pay,
to whom, on which network, in which asset.

## 3. Pay: sign the requirement, retry with X-PAYMENT

**Base rail:** the client signs an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` for the
amount in the `base-sepolia` entry and base64-encodes the signed payload into one
header.

**Solana rail:** the client builds an SPL `transferChecked` of `1000` USDC
atomic units to the `solana` entry's `payTo`, signs the serialized transaction,
and base64-encodes that envelope into the same header.

Either way it is one header. Doing it by hand is miserable — use the client
instead:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0x... npm run client        # runs examples/agent-client.ts
```

Under the hood it retries:

```
GET /availability?party=2
X-PAYMENT: eyJ4NDAyVmVyc2lvbiI6MSwic2NoZW1lIjoiZXhhY3QiLC...
```

## 4. 200 + artifact + settlement receipt

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE: eyJzdWNjZXNzIjp0cnVlLCJ0cmFuc2FjdGlvbiI6IjB4YWJjLi4uIiwibmV0d29yayI6ImJhc2Utc2Vwb2xpYSJ9
Content-Type: application/json

{ "restaurant": {...}, "slots": [ { "date": "...", "time": "19:00", ... } ] }
```

`X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` base64-decodes to the settlement result — `{ success,
transaction, network, payer }`. The `network` field tells you which rail
actually settled. That is your on-chain receipt.

Settlement runs *after* the handler succeeds: if the booking is rejected you get
a `4xx` and no money moves.

## 5. Booking and cancelling

```bash
# paid ($0.01 refundable hold) — via the client, or any x402 library
# returns: reservationId, cancelToken, ics (base64), refund terms, signature

# free cancel with the cancelToken from the booking artifact:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4021/cancel/res_XXXX \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"cancelToken":"YOUR_TOKEN"}' | jq
```
